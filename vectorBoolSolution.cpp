Several alternatives offer better performance than std::vector<bool>: 

1. **std::vector<char>:**  Use a vector of chars.  Each char can store multiple boolean values (using bit manipulation) while providing better access performance.
2. **std::vector<bool> with careful implementation:** If memory optimization is critical and you understand the implications, optimize access to minimize performance overhead.  Avoid unnecessary element access.
3. **boost::dynamic_bitset<>:**  Consider using boost::dynamic_bitset<> which provides a more efficient and robust implementation of a dynamic bitset.

The `vectorBoolSolution.cpp` provides an example using std::vector<char> for improved performance.
