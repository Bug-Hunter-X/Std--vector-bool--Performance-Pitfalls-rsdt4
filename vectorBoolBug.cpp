std::vector<bool> is a specialized container in C++ that uses a bit to represent each boolean value, leading to memory efficiency but potential performance drawbacks when accessing individual elements.  It's not uncommon for programmers to expect it to behave identically to std::vector<T> for other types, which can lead to unexpected behavior. For example, indexing operations might be slower due to the bit manipulation involved.
